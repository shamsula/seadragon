The goal is to get bring in OpenSeaDragon to display the enclosed files. The image files are in the "dzi" format, useful for allowing hi-res images to be zoomed in/out with little quality loss. You can use React or Vue hold and display the library. Using create-react-app or vue-cli is perfectly fine to cut down on tooling time. If using React, hooks are preferred to classes. Minimal styling is required and use of the enclosed ui icon pack is optional.

Once complete, please share your git repo, preferably with a live GitHub Page.
